This resource offers a starting point to learn more about the technologies
which allow sensing data from environments. Although it focuses mostly on sensing spatial data,
it also covers other sensing technologies within the Internet of Things (IoT) context.


By the end of this session you are expected to be able to:

- Understand the underpinning concepts related to sensing spatial data from environments through processes
such as photogrammetry.
- Generate 3D models via photogrammetry processes.
- Understand the basics of sensing in VR headsets.
